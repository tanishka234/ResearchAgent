# ResearchAgent
An Agentic AI that assists with academic and scientific research tasks—summarizing papers, organizing references, drafting sections, and managing citations. This is ideal because: It aligns well with IBM watsonx.ai’s strengths in text summarization, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and document ingestion.
